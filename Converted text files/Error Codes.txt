Cabling issues
Installation configuration issues
Network issues
Recommended Resolutions
Check all cable runs for issues, failed components
Ensure Client connections are correct
Enable Wireless-Ethernet Bridging (WET)
IF the router has a setting for WET (many routers may not), this should be ENABLED
Increase DHCP Lease Time
DHCP Lease Time in the router settings should be set for 24 hours or longer
This is often set in minutes, with 1440 minutes equaling 24 hours
Disable DHCP when 2 routers are on the same network
If there are 2 routers on the network (for instance, the customer has a gateway provided by their ISP and also a mesh Wi-Fi system), disable DHCP on the first router
Bridge Mode should also be turned off for the router that you are disabling DHCP on
Create a 2nd Subnet
Install a 2nd router to create a separate subnet with only the Hopper system connected to it
This process is outlined in Receiver Broadband Connectivity
Best practices
Have the customer log in to the router and navigate/change settings themselves
Perform a web search for "default username and password" and "router login url" and include the ISP and model of the customer's router in the search
This will tell you which IP address/URL to navigate to in the browser in order to log in to their router
NOTE: The router login is often set to the default (often "admin" and "password") but may have been changed by the customer
NOTE: Changing DHCP, WET, and Bridging settings will vary by router model but are often found in the "Advanced" section of the router settings menu
